<h1> Stock Market Prediction using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</h1>

<h4>Introduction:</h4>

<p align=justify>Machine learning and deep learning have found their place in the financial institutions for their power in predicting time series data with high degrees of accuracy and the research is still going on to make the models better. This project was done in order to complete the academic project of Data Mining.</p>

<h4>Project workflow The workflow for this project is essentially in these steps:</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li> Problem Understanding</li>
<li> Data Cleaning</li>
<li> Simple RNNs Issue</li> 
<li> LSTM (Deep Learning)</li>
<li> GRU (Deep Learning)</li>
<li> Conclusion</li>

<h4>What are Stocks?</h4>

<p align=justify>Stock represents a claim on the company's assets and earnings. As you acquire more stock, your ownership stake in the company becomes greater.</p>

<h4>What is stock price prediction?</h4>

<p align=justify> Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit.
  
<h4>Stock market analysis is divided into two parts:</h4>
<p align=justify>
<b>Fundamental analysis :</b> involves analyzing a company’s financial statements to determine the fair value of the business.<br>
<b>Technical analysis :</b> assumes that a security’s price already reflects all publicly-available information and instead focuses on the statistical analysis of price movements.
